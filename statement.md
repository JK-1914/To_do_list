# 📄 Project Statement – Smart To-Do List

## 1. Problem Statement
Many students and working individuals struggle to manage their daily tasks effectively.  
Tasks are often forgotten, unorganized, or missed due to the absence of a simple, structured system.  
A lightweight task management tool is required to help users organize, track, and complete their tasks on time.

The Smart To-Do List project aims to solve this problem by providing a simple, console-based task manager where users can add tasks, view them, mark them as completed, and delete them when no longer needed.

## 2. Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes:
- Designing a **user-friendly console interface**
- Implementing basic task management features
- Creating a **modular Java application** with packages (controller, service, model, utils, main)
- Validating user input such as date formats
- Managing tasks entirely in memory (no database required)
- Ensuring clean code, proper structure, and error handling

This project focuses on applying Java programming concepts, modularization, object-oriented design, and validation utilities taught in the flipped course.

## 3. Target Users
The system is useful for:
- Students managing assignments and study schedules  
- Professionals handling daily work tasks  
- Anyone who wants a simple digital task organizer  
- Beginners learning programming concepts and project structuring  

The tool is designed for users who prefer a **simple console-based application** without complex user interfaces.

- **Delete Task**  
  Users can remove any task using its ID.

- **Input Validation**  
  Ensures due dates follow the correct `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

- **Modular Architecture**  
  Code is separated into controller, service, model, utils, and main packages for maintainability.
